# 🧠 NeuroBit Backend

NeuroBit is a full-stack **telemedicine platform** designed for doctor-patient interaction, built with the **MERN stack**. This repository contains the **backend** code, built with **Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT**, and **Nodemailer**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧑‍⚕️ Role-based access for `doctor` and `patient`
- 🔒 JWT-based authentication and route protection
- 📬 Email notifications for appointment booking (via Nodemailer)
- 🗂️ Modular folder structure (Controllers, Routes, Models, Middleware)
- 🧾 RESTful API design for scalability and ease of integration

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neurobit.git
cd neurobit/server
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in `server/` with the following content:

```env
PORT=5000
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/medicall
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
```

> 🔐 *Use an App Password for Gmail SMTP (2FA enabled).*

4. **Run the server**

```bash
npm start
```

Server will run at `http://localhost:5000`

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- **Signup/Login** generates a JWT token.
- Token is verified via `authenticate` middleware.
- Role-based access (`doctor` / `patient`) is enforced via `restrict` middleware.

---

## 📬 Email Notification

Nodemailer is used to send emails to doctors upon booking an appointment.

- **Service**: Gmail SMTP
- **Config**: Set in `appointmentController.js` or moved to `.env` for production.
